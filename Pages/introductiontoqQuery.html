        Introduction to jQuery
      </h2>
      <p>
        jQuery is an open source JavaScript library that simplifies the
        interactions between an HTML/CSS document, or more precisely the
        Document Object Model (DOM), and JavaScript. Elaborating the terms,
        jQuery simplifies HTML document traversing and manipulation, browser
        event handling, DOM animations, Ajax interactions, and cross-browser
        JavaScript development. Note: The only library available today that
        meets the needs of both designer types and programmer types is jQuery.
        jQuery is widely famous with its philosophy of “Write less, do more.”
        This philosophy can be further elaborated as three concepts: Finding
        some elements (via CSS selectors) and doing something with them (via
        jQuery methods) i.e. locate a set of elements in the DOM, and then do
        something with that set of elements. Chaining multiple jQuery methods on
        a set of elements Using the jQuery wrapper and implicit iteration
