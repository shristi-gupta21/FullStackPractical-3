        Introduction to BootStrap
      </h2>
      <p>
        Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating
        responsive websites and web applications. It is the most popular HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile-first
        websites. It solves many problems which we had once, one of which is the
        cross-browser compatibility issue. Nowadays, the websites are perfect
        for all the browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and for all sizes of
        screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones). All thanks to
        Bootstrap developers -Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton of Twitter, though it
        was later declared to be an open-source project. Why Bootstrap? Faster
        and Easier Web Development. It creates Platform-independent web pages.
        It creates Responsive Web-pages. It designed to be responsive to mobile
        devices too. It is Free! Available on www.getbootstrap.com
