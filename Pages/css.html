      CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is a standard style sheet
      language used for describing the presentation (i.e. the layout and
      formatting) of the web pages. Prior to CSS, nearly all of the
      presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML
      markup (specifically inside the HTML tags); all the font colors,
      background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be
      explicitly described within the HTML. As a result, development of the
      large websites became a long and expensive process, since the style
      information were repeatedly added to every single page of the website.
