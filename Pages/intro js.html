      In this topic, we have discussed the Introduction to JavaScript as it is a
      lightweight dynamic programming language. Programs written in this
      language are called as scripts, these scripts are embedded in web pages,
      and they can manipulate the HTML content. These scripts execute as web
      pages are loaded; JavaScript’s do not need to have complied to execute.
      Previously JavaScript was known as LiveScript, but later it was changed to
      JavaScript. As Java was very popular at that time, and introducing a new
      language with the similarity in names would be beneficial, they thought.
      But later, JavaScript became an independent language with its own
      specification called ECMAScript. Netscape 2.0 is the first where the
      implementation of JavaScript was first seen. The syntax of JavaScript is
      more influenced by programming language ‘C.’
