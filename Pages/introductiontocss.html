        Introduction to CSS

      <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed
        language intended to simplify the process of making web pages
        presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More
        importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that
        makes up each web page. CSS is easy to learn and understood, but it
        provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. WHY
        CSS? CSS saves time: You can write CSS once and reuse the same sheet in
        multiple HTML pages. Easy Maintainence: To make a global change simply
        change the style, and all elements in all the webpages will be updated
        automatically. Search Engines: CSS is considered a clean coding
        technique, which means search engines won’t have to struggle to “read”
        its content. Superior styles to HTML: CSS has a much wider array of
        attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML
        page in comparison to HTML attributes. Offline Browsing: CSS can store
        web applications locally with the help of an offline cache. Using this
        we can view offline websites.
