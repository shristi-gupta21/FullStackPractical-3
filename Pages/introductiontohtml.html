        Introduction to HTML
      </h2>
      <p>
        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language .HTML is the standard markup
        language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web
        page.HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the
        browser how to display the content. HTML elements label pieces of
        content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a
        link", etc.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from
        local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML
        describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
        included cues for the appearance of the document. HTML elements are the
        building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
        objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered
        page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
        structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists,
        links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags,
        written using angle brackets.
